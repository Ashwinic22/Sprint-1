SPLINT REPORT

Splint 3.1.2 --- 20 Feb 2018

scheduler.c: (in function readFile)

scheduler.c:53:29: Possibly null storage fp passed as non-null param:

fgets (..., fp)

A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal

parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation. If NULL may be used for this

parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.

(Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)

scheduler.c:50:10: Storage fp may become null

scheduler.c:58:40: Possibly null storage token passed as non-null param:

strcpy (..., token)

scheduler.c:57:17: Storage token may become null

scheduler.c:60:38: Possibly null storage token passed as non-null param:

strcpy (..., token)

scheduler.c:59:17: Storage token may become null

scheduler.c:62:36: Possibly null storage token passed as non-null param:

atoi (token)

scheduler.c:61:17: Storage token may become null

scheduler.c:64:39: Possibly null storage token passed as non-null param:

strcpy (..., token)

scheduler.c:63:17: Storage token may become null

scheduler.c:68:5: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(fp)

Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast

result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalint to inhibit warning)

scheduler.c: (in function findDisplayAndRemoveInvalidJobs)

scheduler.c:96:21: Possibly null storage fp passed as non-null param:

fprintf (fp, ...)

scheduler.c:79:10: Storage fp may become null

scheduler.c: (in function writeSchedule)

scheduler.c:172:9: Buffer overflow possible with sprintf. Recommend using

snprintf instead: sprintf

Use of function that may lead to buffer overflow. (Use -bufferoverflowhigh to

inhibit warning)

scheduler.c:174:17: Possibly null storage fp passed as non-null param:

fprintf (fp, ...)

scheduler.c:173:14: Storage fp may become null

scheduler.c:180:9: Return value (type int) ignored: fclose(fp)

scheduler.c: (in function main)

scheduler.c:193:18: Passed storage *jobList contains 5 undefined fields:

jobNo, description, machineNo, duration, clientName

Storage derivable from a parameter, return value or global is not defined.

Use /*@out@*/ to denote passed or returned storage which need not be defined.

(Use -compdef to inhibit warning)

scheduler.c:193:27: Passed storage &jobCount not completely defined:

readFile (..., &jobCount, ...)

scheduler.c:196:37: Passed storage *jobList contains 5 undefined fields:

jobNo, description, machineNo, duration, clientName

scheduler.c:196:46: Passed storage &jobCount not completely defined:

findDisplayAndRemoveInvalidJobs (..., &jobCount, ...)

scheduler.c:202:36: Passed storage *scheduleList contains 4 undefined fields:

jobNo, machineNo, start, end

scheduler.c:202:50: Passed storage &scheduleCount not completely defined:

scheduleJob (..., &scheduleCount)

scheduler.c:207:52: Passed storage *(machineScheduleList->jobScheduleList)

contains 7 undefined fields: jobNo, description, machineNo, duration, ...

scheduler.c:207:52: Passed storage *machineScheduleList contains 2 undefined

fields: machineNo, jobScheduleCount

scheduler.c:47:6: Function exported but not used outside scheduler: readFile

A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can

use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
